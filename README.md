# TriSys-API-JS
The Javascript interface to the TriSys Web API hosted at https://api.trisys.co.uk
This is a single javascript file containing AJAX (asynchronous javascript and XML) code which wraps up the complexity of connecting to remote web services.
All the samples in the TriSys Web API documentation utilise this file so this is open sourced to allow web and mobile developers to quickly assemble line of business recruitment applications.
